	ASM Scripts Require xkas or asar to compile the asm, you can easily find them on google (i recommend asar)
	<br>
	how to patch a rom with the asm file : 
	<br>
	Run a command line window (CTRL+R) type `cmd` enter
	<br>
	Place your asm files and your rom in the same folder then type `cd "yourfolderpath"`
	<br>
	you should now have something like `C:\myasmScripts>` now depending on what program you have you type
	<br>
	`asar.exe scriptfile.asm romfile.sfc`  `xkas.exe scriptfile.asm romfile.sfc`
	<br>
	Your  rom is now patched !, you can run your romfile.sfc and see if it worked :)
